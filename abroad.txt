The impetus for pursuing a master's degree in Finance at McMaster University stems from a comprehensive engagement with multiculturalism studies, exposure to an international environment, and a firsthand encounter with the complexities of the trade war. This, coupled with a keen interest in delving into the underlying factors of the financial industry amidst globalization's economic events, fuels my academic aspirations. Inspired by the notable achievements of Nobel laureates associated with McMaster, I am drawn to the institution's distinguished legacy. The prospect of enhancing my competitiveness in the job market, achieving higher career goals, and accessing a robust alumni network motivates my choice to get a master's degree in finance.
My sustained interest in historical financial events and active participation in finance-related online courses and forums reflect a commitment to continuous learning. Engaging with virtual currencies, particularly Bitcoin, through investments and participation in related communities has deepened my insights into the digital currency and fintech sectors; this was led by my involvement in an investment exchange group during high school, focused on researching and analyzing stocks, funds, and other investment products, which was probably one of my first experiments in this field. It is also interesting to note that I maintain a financial-focused blog, which has enhanced my understanding of financial concepts and honed my communication skills within the professional sphere.
Throughout my undergraduate years, excelling in macroeconomics, probability theory, mathematical statistics, and econometrics courses has provided a solid foundation for comprehending the stock market, financial modelling, and investment strategies. I have also demonstrated exceptional adaptability and fast learning skills, especially with my quick understanding of modern technology encompassing the fields of AI, VR, big data, and IoT, all of which hold immense importance in today's technology-driven era where every industry is impacted by and dependent on digital tools. With Atour Hotel's business research and analysis course project, I gained practical experience conducting in-depth business analyses of enterprises and engaging in microeconomic experiments in designing insurance products, enriching my analytical and strategic skills. In another project, I leveraged Python for data analysis, particularly influencer data from YouTube, expanding my programming and data processing skills. Moreover, my professional tenure as a Data Analytics and Investment Assistant Intern has provided practical insights into business operations and management challenges.
Post-program, my professional goal is to become an investment analyst, contributing to the asset handling of an insurance company. In the long term, aspiring to the CFO role in a major insurance firm motivates my academic journey, where I would oversee financial strategy and capital allocation. The interdisciplinary nature of the Master of Finance program complements my undergraduate background in insurance, facilitating a nuanced understanding of risk mitigation and asset management. Proficiency in versatile tools such as Python further positions me to contribute significantly to the finance industry. The familial legacy of financial education, personal financial planning, and active tracking of financial news contribute to my well-rounded understanding of finance.
